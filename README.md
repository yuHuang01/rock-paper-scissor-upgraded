This is my second JavaScript project.
And it is an upgraded version of the first one.
Added buttons so the user don't have to type in the chosen item.
If the user or the computer managed to get 5 point the JS will announce the winner with alert.
But still have to refresh the page in order to restart the game
And there must be a more fancy way to display the current result.
